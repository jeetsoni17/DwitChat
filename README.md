Overview

DwitChat is a decentralized social media platform built using blockchain technology to overcome the privacy, security, and control limitations of traditional centralized social networks. Centralized platforms store user data on proprietary servers, leading to risks such as data breaches, opaque moderation, censorship, and biased algorithms.

DwitChat adopts a decentralized architecture that empowers users with full control over their identity, content, and interactions. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and wallet-based authentication through MetaMask, the platform ensures transparency, data ownership, and secure peer-to-peer communication.

Blockchain-backed transparency and immutability via Ethereum smart contracts

NFT-based content feeds ensuring ownership and authenticity

Direct tipping mechanism to reward content creators

Community-driven awards and engagement incentives

Decentralized censorship without a central authority
